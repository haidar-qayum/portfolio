# My Portfolio

Hello! I'm Haidar, a passionate data analyst with specific skills in transforming raw data into actionable insights. I am currently studying at the University of Reading expecting a First Class Honours in BSc Computer Science. I have a strong background in data analysis and have been a top performer for data related modules. This portfolio demonstrates a collection of personal projects that showcase my proficiency in SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. I am constantly updating this repository as I expand and grow my technical skill set for Data Analytics. Feel free to download copies of code and files and interact with various different projects.
