# My Portfolio

Hello! I'm Haidar, a passionate data analyst with expertise in transforming raw data into actionable insights. I am currently pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Reading, where I anticipate graduating with First Class Honours. My strong background in data analysis is evidenced by my top performance in data-related modules. This portfolio showcases a collection of personal projects that highlight my proficiency in SQL, Excel, Tableau, Power BI, and Python. I am continually updating this repository as I expand my technical skill set in Data Analytics. Feel free to download the code and files, and explore the various projects.
